# Game Design

## Vision

AsciiHero is a retro browser-based platform game that looks and feels like an
animated ASCII/text-mode game, while providing smooth, modern movement and
scrolling. The game should feel deliberately constrained by ASCII aesthetics,
not like a pixel-art game with ASCII characters placed on top.

## Visual Style

- Pure ASCII/text-mode visual language.
- Monospaced glyphs form the game world (e.g. `@`, `#`, `█`, `░`, `│`, `─`).
- Colour is part of the ASCII visual language. Each cell's foreground/background
  colour is a single-character code (`0-9` plus `A-V`, 32 possible codes)
  looked up in a shared palette (`Colors.ini`, see
  [AssetFormat.md](AssetFormat.md)). Codes are allocated mnemonically and
  added as needed (e.g. `K`=blacK, `W`=White, `R`=Red) rather than filled in
  sequentially — only as many as are actually used need to be defined.
- The visual grid is a rendering concept only — it does not restrict movement
  or physics (see [Architecture.md](Architecture.md#coordinate-system)).
- Sprites and levels are authored as plain-text ASCII assets; see
  [AssetFormat.md](AssetFormat.md) for the file format reference.
- Idle characters/objects are not required to be perfectly static: a clip may
  define multiple frames purely for subtle animation (e.g. the player
  occasionally blinking while standing still), reusing the same frame
  mechanism also used for static shape variants (see
  [AssetFormat.md](AssetFormat.md#21-layers)).

## Gameplay

- 2D platforming with responsive player movement.
- Gravity and jumping.
- Platform collision.
- Smooth horizontal and vertical camera scrolling.

## Experience Goals

- Retro computer/terminal aesthetic.
- Smooth, responsive controls.
- Clear visual hierarchy.
- Strong sense of movement despite the text-based rendering.
- Consistent ASCII aesthetic throughout the game.
